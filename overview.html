        <h1>Responsive Redesign: Museum of Natural History & Planetarium</h1>
        <p>
          For the purposes of redesigning a webpage and giving a user a better 
          interface to interact with and an overall better experience, I have 
          chosen to redesign the page of the Museum of Natural History & Planetarium
          in Roger Williams Park, Providence, RI.
        </p>
        <p>
          The link to the original page can be found 
          <a href="https://www.providenceri.gov/museum/" target="_blank">here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>Original Site Screenshot</h2>
        <p>
          Here is an image of the site I was working with as of May 1st, 2025:
        </p>
          <h2>Scrollable Image Window</h2>
          <div class="scroll-window">
            <img src="images/old-website-vert.png" alt="Original Site Before Redesign">
          </div>
        <p>
          The reason why I chose to redesign this site specifically is because 
          the site has a relatively basic layout that is a bit outdated by today’s
          standards, so there is a lot of room for improvement. As a student going
          to university in Providence, RI, I thought that examining older UIs in 
          the city would be a really interesting project for me personally as 
          well!

        <h2>Conceptual Modeling</h2>
        <p>
          The conceptual model of the site is also quite interesting. It clearly 
          implies that this is an informational site for a local museum with generic
          information like hours, location, events, and tickets to be found on the
          homepage. However, the information is so scattered that the site is
          actually hard to navigate and use. The uninviting nature of the site 
          creates various barriers to getting from point A to B on the page.
        </p>

        <p>
          When analyzing the web page’s usability, I categorized my findings into
          three key values of web design: efficiency, learnability, and 
          memorability. Let’s examine them below.
        </p>

        <table class="usability-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Efficiency</th>
              <th>Learnability</th>
              <th>Memorability</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <!-- Efficiency -->
              <td>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Some key actions like “Buy Tickets” or “Membership” are right at the top of the site.</li>
                  <li>Contact information and hours are clearly present.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>The top of the page has a large banner that is a bit out of place and the headers are redundant (ex: the museum name is listed multiple times).</li>
                  <li>Some of the buttons could be more informative to the user (ex: “View More” could be “View Upcoming Events”).</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
        
              <!-- Learnability -->
              <td>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Layout components used are similar with other sites such as columns, buttons, and links.</li>
                  <li>Fonts and colors are simple and allow for baseline levels of readability.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Navigation links are quite small and feel unimportant.</li>
                  <li>There is no strong sense of a visual hierarchy so you can’t truly tell what is important.</li>
                  <li>Some calls-to-actions (ex: “Join Today” or “Lend a Hand”) feel like they are just floating around and don’t connect to any other themes on the site.</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
        
              <!-- Memorability -->
              <td>
                <strong>Strengths:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>The core structure is basic and linear so it's not hard to remember the basic layout.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>The visual design is boring and generic so therefore nothing really stands out about the page that is worth remembering.</li>
                  <li>Buttons and calls-to-action don’t have consistent styling or placements so interaction patterns aren’t intuitive.</li>
                </ul>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>WebAIM WAVE Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          I also used WebAIM WAVE to assist in the evaluation of the page’s 
          commitment to accessibility and found that the site does have 
          considerations taken into account but still leaves much to be desired. 
          Here are a few things that I noticed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Important information doesn’t stand out due to the lack of a consistent
            visual hierarchy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigating the site is quite difficult due to the inconsistent and 
            cluttered navigation menu and page sections.
          </li>
          <li>
            The page also does not translate very well to a mobile or tablet 
            sized layout. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The contrast of most elements on the page is quite low, which makes the
            site harder to perceive for people with visual disabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Forms are not properly labeled so that those using screen readers can 
            understand the layout of the site.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            For those who don’t know, WebAIM WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation 
            Tool) is a free tool created by WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind) 
            to help find a website’s accessibility issues so that those 
            responsible for the design and upkeep of the site can work to 
            dismantle all barriers that affect a user’s ability to perceive or 
            interact with a site due to their disability. 
          </p>
